useful information I've picked up while learning and using Stata. Hat tip to Alan Acock's [**A Gentle Introduction to Stata**](https://www.stata.com/bookstore/gentle-introduction-to-stata)

## descriptive univariate stats
This section has a brief overview of obtaining descriptive statistics and some simple graphics in Stata.  First, see the [markdown](https://github.com/JACKMCDONNELL/useful-stata/blob/master/descriptive%20stats.md) and if you want to reproduce the analysis yourself, check out the [do file](https://github.com/JACKMCDONNELL/useful-stata/blob/master/descriptive%20stats.do) 

## bivariate stats
This section discusses Stata commands for bivariate comparisons.  Check out the [markdown](https://github.com/JACKMCDONNELL/useful-stata/blob/master/bivariate.md) and [do file](https://github.com/JACKMCDONNELL/useful-stata/blob/master/bivariate.do) to learn more.
